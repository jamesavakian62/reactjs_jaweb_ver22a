      question: "What Sets Sports Cars Apart from Ordinary Cars?",
      answer: `Imagine yourself driving around Los Angeles in an incredible piece
            of machinery designed and built for swiftness, power, speed, and
            unbelievable performance. Sports cars were originally strictly made
            for races and tracks, but after 1945, men who were returning from
            war fell in love with these beauties and the thrilling ride they
            offer. These days, you will see sports cars of all shapes, sizes,
            colors, and brands owning the streets of Los Angeles. Below are just
            some of the features that distinguish sports cars from ordinary
            vehicles:      `,

      question: " Unbelievable Speed",
      answer: `Sports cars are undeniably the king of the road. There is a good
            reason these vehicles are compared to the speed of light. Several of
            these cars are even faster compared to the speed of light itself.
            For instance, in the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing
            (NASCAR), their acceleration power is so extreme that it takes them
            about 3 to 3.5 seconds to go from 0 to 60 km/h. Standard vehicles
            have an average speed of approximately 60mph, yet their incapacity
            to cut corners makes them lag behind sports cars. The need for speed
            is indeed ingrained in sports cars and this makes them the ultimate
            car champion.

      question: "Excellent Engine Performance",
      answer: `            The engines of sports cars are top-of-the-line and designed for peak
            performance horsepower and torque. The standard engine is made to
            keep longevity and fuel efficiency in mind, so performance is not
            the main priority in ordinary vehicles. As far as sports cars are
            concerned, considering that their engine is crafted from lightweight
            materials, these vehicles perform much better on the road compared
            to ordinary cars. All sports cars are also intended to leverage
            their performance aspects. A great example of this is McLaren which
            has been meant to be aerodynamic to offer support to its overall
            speed.

      question: "Unrivaled Beauty",
      answer: `           Modern-day sports cars are not only the epitome of agility and
            performance but are also the most beautiful beasts that ever grazed
            the streets of the world. They are extremely captivating and
            instantly turn heads anywhere they go. From the gorgeous Corvette
            Convertible to the shark-like exterior of the Ford Mustang, for
            instance, these sports cars are all-powerful in their own rights.
            They speak a lot about the fine artisan and craftsmanship skills
            that go into designing both the interior and exterior of every unit.   `,

      question:
        "   The beauty of these vehicles is that they are not only beautiful ...           ",
